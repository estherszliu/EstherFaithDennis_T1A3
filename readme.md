## Feature - Create Employee
I will explain a plan for create employee feature

### How it will be implemented
It will be implemented with a `def valid_create_inputs(inputs)` for validate and a `def create_employee(employee_data)` function. The input data will be a list of inputs give by the user. It will check if the user input is correct before writing the new employee to a local csv file. 

### Task checklist for create employees
- [ ] Validate the number of input
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 12 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Validate the input is correct
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 13 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print fail message to the user if the input is incorrect
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 14 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Write employee data to csv file
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 14 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print fail message to the user if writing to the file is fail
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 14 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print success message to the user
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 14 Dec 2023 

Most the task is high priority because create feature is needed for all other feature to work properly. 


## Feature - Search employee
I will explain a plan for search employee feature

### How it will be implemented
It will be implemented with a `def valid_search_inputs(inputs)`for validate and a `def search_employee(search_data))` function. The input data will be the employee's ID which will be the number by the user input. 

### Task checklist for search employees
- [ ] Validate the input is correct
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 15 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print fail message to the user if the input incorrect
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 15 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Validate the input is match the employee data
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 15 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print fail message to the user if the input can not found in the  employee data
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 15 Dec 2023 
- [ ] Print the employee data to the user
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 15 Dec 2023 

Most the task is high priority because search feature is needed for all other feature to work properly. 

## Feature - Update employee
I will explain a plan for update employee feature

### How it will be implemented
It will be implemented with a `def valid_update_inputs(inputs)`for validate and a `def update_data(update_employee)` function. The input data will be the employee's ID which will be the number by the user input. 

### Task checklist for update employees
- [ ] Validate the input is correct
    * Priority: High
    * Due Date: 16 Dec 2023

- [ ] Print the employee data to the user
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 16 Dec 2023

## Feature - Delete employee
I will explain a plan for delete employee feature

### How it will be implemented
It will be implemented with a `def valid_delete_inputs(inputs)` for validate and `def delete_data(delete_employee)` function. The input data will be the employee's ID which will be the number by the user input. 

### Task checklist for delete employees

- [ ] Print the sucessful delete messege to the user
    * Priority: Medium
    * Due Date: 16 Dec 2023 

Most the task is high priority because delete feature is needed for all other feature to work properly.

# Code Style Guide
For code styling, I have chosen to usd PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code.Here is the link to [link toPEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (Hattori, n.d.) PEP8 helps to organise the code more consistency and help to improve the readerblity. I have been using the autopep8 to auto adjust the code style for me. Here is the link to [link to autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) (Hattori, n.d.) This autopep8 is a auto adjustment of PEP 8, once you download it and excute it, it will change the file style automaticaly.
